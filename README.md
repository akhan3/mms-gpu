Micromagnetic simulator on CUDA

## Introduction
This code is a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simualtor written from scratch to simulate micromagnetics phenomenon.
It uses fast multipole algorithm (FMM) for magnetic potential calculation and speeds it up through CUDA toolkit 3.x.

## Collaborators
It was written in the summer of 2010 as my Master's thesis at Technical University of Munich 
in collaboration with Prof. Gyorgy Csaba at University of Notre Dame.
